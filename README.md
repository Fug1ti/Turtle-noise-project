# Turtle-noise-project
Generating shapes using dots with turtle!

So far, this project only really generates cubes. It's also incredibly slow due to the fact that each dot must be generated by a single pen. There's not parallel processing or anything of the likes with this library. Still kinda cool in my opinion!
